= Fetch Pocketcast starred episodes

== Intro
This program uses the Pocketcast web-player to get the metadata for your starred episodes. It then fetches the actual file from the original source  and tags them with id3v2.

It remembers the files it have successfully downloaded

== Usage
You need a username and password for https://play.pocketcasts.com. (Well, at least the first time you run it, it saves the auth token)

It should build with `./build.sh` (it justs builds *.go in src)

run with:
```
./fetch-starred "username" "password"
```

or set the environment variables `PCUSERNAME` and `PCPASSWORD`

== Output files

- Mp3s go in `downloaded/`
- The id's of the sucessfully downloaded episodes are saved in `downloaded-successfully.txt`
- The auth token (jwt) is saved in `authtoken.jwt`
